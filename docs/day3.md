# Day 3: `github-games`

### In Class Activities:
- Worked on another, third repository.
  - Just like the merge conflict repository, everyone has their own repository, and we will run scripts against it to track your progress. (Don't you love automation? :robot:)
- More advanced Git problems and solutions including (but not limited to :wink:):
  - GitHub Flow
  - Atomic commits with `git add-p`
  - `git bisect`, `git revert` and changing history
  - `git log` and aliases

### After Class Activities:

If possible, try to meet with one or more people from your class. (We can help you partner up if you'd like!) Discuss what you have learned and how it will impact your workflows. If you can't find someone to partner with sychronously, set up an async conversation. Spend some time writing reflections on the same points, and post them in an issue in the class repository. 

Not sure where to start? Here are some conversation seeds to plant:
- What is a branch, really?
- How is branching cheap?
- What is master?
- When and why should you create a new branch, even when you are working alone?
- What happens when you create a branch?
- What happens when you are done with a branch?
- What is an example of a perfect pull request?
- Which branching strategy will we use?
- Which branch will serve as our "master" or deployed code?
- Will we use naming conventions for our branches?
- How will we use labels and assignees?
- Will we use milestones? Projects?
- Will we have required elements of Issues or Pull Requests (e.g. shipping checklists)?
- How will we indicate sign-off on Pull Requests?
- Who will merge pull requests?
