# Day 1: Getting Started with GitHub Flow

### In Class Activities:
- Work in the class repository together, a slide deck of images and captions.
- Talk about [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
- Take a brief tour of what a GitHub repository looks like.
- Comment on an issue.
  - See what an issue is like, disuss what issues are used for.
  - Behind the scenes, we use this comment to add you as a collaborator.
  - We also create a document for you to work on later.
- Clone the repository locally, and [get the site set up to build locally](https://github.com/githubtraining/caption-this#instructions-local-setup).
- Together, practice GitHub flow to change your page of the slide deck and add a caption.
  - Creating a branch.
  - Making (a) commit(s).
- Create a pull request.

### After Class Activities:

#### 1. Complete a code review of someone else's slide file.
  - Since you're partnered, and everyone wants a review, both you and your partner should complete a review of different pull requests.
  - Find an open pull request with no review in the class repository
  - Leave a review of the changes within the pull request (Not sure how? [Click here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/) for more information.)

#### 2. Pick another open issue to work on together. These tasks could be creating more slides, adding a new layout, or adding tests.
  - In the class repository, there are several open issues. You can find them by looking at the Project page or in the Issues tab. Each issue lists a different task you can complete to improve the class repository. 
  - Pick an issue, and follow the instructions linked within it. 
  - Regardless of which issue you choose, you will practice the GitHub flow again on your own and create a new pull request.
